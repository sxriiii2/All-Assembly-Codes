Question 1: Write a program to transfer a string of data i.e. your name, from code space starting at address 200H to RAM locations starting at 20H and then to RAM locations starting at 50H. Using the simulator, single-step through the program and examine the data transfer and registers.
Answer:
Code:
ORG 0000H
MOV A, #00H
MOV DPTR, #0200H
MOV R1, #0EH

Question 1:
Develop an Assembly Language Program (ALP) using interrupts to do the following:
a) Receive data serially and send to P1
b) Read port 2, transmit data serially, and give a copy to P0
c) Make timer 0 generate a square wave of 2 KHz frequency on P3.6
Assume that XTAL = 11.0592 MHz. Set the baud rate at 9600.
Code:
ORG 0000H
LJMP MAIN
ORG 000BH ;ISR for Timer 0
CPL P3.6 ;Toggle P3.6
RETI
ORG 0023H
LJMP SERIAL ;Jump to serial ISR
ORG 30H
MAIN:
MOV P1, #0FFH ;Make P1 and input port
MOV TMOD, #22H ;Timer 0 and 1, mode 2, auto-reload
MOV TH1, #-3 ;Baud rate of 9600
MOV SCON, #50H ;8-bit, 1 stop, REN enabled
MOV TH0, #-92H ;for 2kHz frequency
MOV IE, #10010010B ;enable serial, timer 0
SETB TR1 ;start timer 1
SETB TR0 ;start timer 0
BACK:
MOV A, P2 ;read data from port P2
MOV SBUF, A ;give a copy to SBUF
MOV P0, A ;send to P0
SJMP BACK ;Stay indefinitely
; serial jump
ORG 100H

MOV A, SBUF ;Otherwise receive data
MOV P1, A ;Move data to P1

Question 2:
Develop an Assembly Language Program (ALP) using interrupts to do the following:
a) Generate a 10 KHz frequency on P2.1 using T0 8-bit auto reload
b) Use timer 1 as an event counter to count up 1-Hz pulse and display it on P0. The pulse
is connected to EX1.
Assume that XTAL = 11.0592 MHz.
Code:
ORG 0000H
LJMP MAIN
ORG 000BH
CPL P2.1 ;toggle P2.1

MOV TH0, #70H ;load TH0 to generate 10 KHz frequency
MOV IE, #10010010B ;enable serial and Timer 0 interrupt
SETB TR0 ;start Timer 0
SETB TR1 ;start Timer 1

2. Assume that the 8051 serial port is connected to the COM port of IBM PC,
P1 and P2 of the 8051 are connected to LEDs and switches, respectively.
Write an 8051-assembly program to
(a) send to PC the message “We Are Ready”,
(b) receive any data send by PC and put it on LEDs connected to P1, and
(c) get data on switches connected to P2 and send it to PC serially.
The program should perform part
(a) once, but parts
(b) and (c) continuously, use 9600 baud rates.
